        <h2>Introduction to Electricity</h2>
        Figure 1 – A picture of a lightning bolt above the Tuscon, Arizona skyline (National Geographic, no date)
        Electricity was first known as lightning, "a potent force of nature formed of a bolt
        ejected from the clouds towards the ground (or vice versa) caused by an imbalance of electrical charges" 
        (National Geographic, no date). We discovered we could generate power from lightning, so it has been at
        the core of several inventions e.g. the light bulb, batteries, electrical machinery and domestic purposes 
        (Just Energy, 2022). Now electricity powers our entire world, from communications technology, electronics
        and home appliances.

     <h2>Impact on Cars </h2> 
      Everyone has been in a car before. They are necessary for transporting people and valuable goods. 
      Private vehicles provide us with “independence and freedom of mobility” while operating on our own schedules. For reference, there are over 246 million cars in the EU,
      all 11.8 years old on average. (ACEA – European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, 2022)
      But they don’t have the best environmental impacts. ICE (internal combustion engines)
      emit harmful greenhouse gases like CO2 linked to global warming.

      To lower emissions, cars were electrified. For example, electric cars, or BEVs (battery electric vehicles) use an electric motor
      powered by batteries storing electrical energy (US Department of Energy, no date). These cars do not emit greenhouse gases while running
      and can be completely powered from home or publicly at charging stations both slow and fast. 
      Level 1/2 chargers are commonly used by home EV owners which charge at a rate of 5 to 25 hours of range per hour charging (1.9-19.2kW). 
      Fast chargers for public use can charge over 150 miles of range in just 30 minutes.  (US Department of Energy, no date)
      However, the driving range concerns most drivers, and EVs are still a developing technology. Hybrid vehicles combine an ICE with an electric motor. 
      Hybrid electric vehicles cannot be plugged in to charge (See Figure 2).

      Figure 2 – An image showing how a hybrid vehicle works - (US Department of Energy, no date)
      A plug-in hybrid (PHEV) is petrol/ diesel fuelled and plugged in to charge (See Figure 3).

      <h2>Impact on Public Transport</h2>
      Other vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas emissions like trains and air transport used for public or cargo use.
      For example, 1.8 billion people travel by rail annually in the UK. (Network Rail, no date) 
      Trains used to be steam locomotives which were fuelled by burning materials like coal to produce steam. 
      (Iowa State University –Institute for transportation, 2016) Since transport is so important to society, trains were electrified.
      Methods of electrifying trains include overhead lines and third rail. Apart from lower running emissions, 
      electrified trains are quieter, making them suitable for construction near towns and cities if necessary.

      <img src="Overhead-Line.png" alt="Overhead lines" width="800" height="300">
      Figure 4: An image of overhead wires
      If you live near a railway line, then you have most likely seen wires like the picture above (See Figure 4).
      These overhead wires provide power to trains. (Swartz Engineering, 2024)
      <img src="Pantograph.webp" alt="Pantograph Roof of Train" width="800" height="300">
      Figure 5: An image of the pantograph 
      The pantograph on the roof of trains (see Figure 5) collects power while operating by touching the electric wires.
      Benefits of overhead wires include efficient power transmission over long distances due to their high voltage,
      they are also 33% cheaper to manufacture and maintain.
      <img src="third-rail-tracks.webp" alt="Third Rail on Tracks" width="800" height="300">
      Figure 6: An image of third rail 
      Another method of electrifying railways is third rail (see Figure 6), which provides power using a conductor rail placed beside rails,
      compatible trains use metal contact blocks. Over 30% of trains in the UK rail network are powered by third rail.
      Some advantages include less infrastructure modifications needed, 
      more affordable, better suited for urban transit like the Underground and less affected by extreme weather conditions.
