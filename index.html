        <h2>Introduction to Electricity</h2>
        Figure 1 – A picture of a lightning bolt above the Tuscon, Arizona skyline (National Geographic, no date)
        Electricity was first known as lightning, "a potent force of nature formed of a bolt
        ejected from the clouds towards the ground (or vice versa) caused by an imbalance of electrical charges" 
        (National Geographic, no date). We discovered we could generate power from lightning, so it has been at
        the core of several inventions e.g. the light bulb, batteries, electrical machinery and domestic purposes 
        (Just Energy, 2022). Now electricity powers our entire world, from communications technology, electronics
        and home appliances.

     <h2>Impact on Cars </h2> 
      Everyone has been in a car before. They are necessary for transporting people and valuable goods. 
      Private vehicles provide us with “independence and freedom of mobility” while operating on our own schedules. For reference, there are over 246 million cars in the EU,
      all 11.8 years old on average. (ACEA – European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, 2022)
      But they don’t have the best environmental impacts. ICE (internal combustion engines)
      emit harmful greenhouse gases like CO2 linked to global warming.

      To lower emissions, cars were electrified. For example, electric cars, or BEVs (battery electric vehicles) use an electric motor
      powered by batteries storing electrical energy (US Department of Energy, no date). These cars do not emit greenhouse gases while running
      and can be completely powered from home or publicly at charging stations both slow and fast. 
      Level 1/2 chargers are commonly used by home EV owners which charge at a rate of 5 to 25 hours of range per hour charging (1.9-19.2kW). 
      Fast chargers for public use can charge over 150 miles of range in just 30 minutes.  (US Department of Energy, no date)
      However, the driving range concerns most drivers, and EVs are still a developing technology. Hybrid vehicles combine an ICE with an electric motor. 
      Hybrid electric vehicles cannot be plugged in to charge (See Figure 2).

      A plug-in hybrid (PHEV) is petrol/ diesel fuelled and plugged in to charge (See Figure 3).
